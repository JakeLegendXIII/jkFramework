# jkFramework
Part of my Dashboard framework.

Accessible by using the jkFramework.js and jkFramework.css files in the Dist folder.

By looking at the Index.html and Index-Old.html you can see the framework in use. The Dashboard portion is created in the file
wwaDashboardDirective.js   This is also where the Angular Gridster widget settings are handled.

This version of the jkFramework is based heavily on Mark Zamoyta's Pluralsight course "Building a SPA Framework Using AngularJS".

I have a production version that is much more advanced and I will work to add some of the non-proprietary pieces to this Repo in the future.
